Introduction</A>
</H1>
The 
electrocardiogram (ECG) is a time-varying signal reflecting the 
ionic current flow which causes the cardiac fibres to contract and 
subsequently relax. 
The surface ECG is obtained by recording the potential difference between  
two electrodes placed on the surface of the skin.
A single normal cycle of the ECG represents the successive atrial 
depolarisation/repolarisation and ventricular depolarisation/repolarisation 
which occurs with every heart beat. These can be approximately associated 
with the peaks and troughs of the ECG waveform labelled P,Q,R,S and T as 
shown in Fig. <A HREF="node1.html#f:garipqrst">1</A>. 

Extracting useful clinical information from the real (noisy) ECG requires 
reliable signal processing techniques [<A
 HREF="node8.html#goldberger77">1</A>]. 
These include R-peak detection [<A
 HREF="node8.html#pan85">2</A>,<A
 HREF="node8.html#kaplan91">3</A>], 
QT-interval detection [<A
 HREF="node8.html#davey99">4</A>] 
and the derivation of heart rate and respiration rate 
from the ECG [<A
 HREF="node8.html#moody85">5</A>,<A
 HREF="node8.html#moody86">6</A>]. 
The RR-interval is the time between 
successive R-peaks, the inverse of this time interval gives the 
instantaneous heart rate. 
A series of RR-intervals is known as a RR tachogram and variability of  
these RR-intervals reveals important information about the physiological state 
of the subject [<A
 HREF="node8.html#malik95">7</A>]. 
At present, new biomedical signal processing algorithms are usually evaluated 
by applying them to ECGs in a large database such as the Physionet 
database [<A
 HREF="node8.html#physionet">8</A>].
While this gives the operator an indication of the accuracy of a given 
algorithm when applied to real data, it is difficult to infer how the 
performance would vary in different clinical settings with a range of
noise levels and sampling frequencies.
Having access to realistic artificial ECG signals may  
facilitate this evaluation.

This paper presents a model for generating a synthetic ECG signal with 
realistic PQRST morphology and prescribed heart rate dynamics.
The aim of this model is to provide a 
standard realistic ECG signal with known characteristics, 
which can be generated with specific statistics  
such as the mean and standard deviation of the heart rate 
and frequency-domain characteristics of heart rate variability (HRV), 
such as the LF/HF ratio, defined as the ratio of power between 0.015 and 
0.15 Hz and 0.15 and 0.4 Hz in the RR tachogram [<A
 HREF="node8.html#malik95">7</A>]. 
By generating a signal which represents a <I>typical</I> human ECG, this 
facilitates a comparison of different signal processing techniques. 
A synthetic ECG can be generated with different sampling frequencies and  
different noise levels in order to establish the performance of  
a given technique. This performance can be presented, for example, 
as the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives and false 
negatives for each test. Such performance assessment could be used as 
a ``standard'' and would enable clinicians to ascertain which biomedical 
signal processing techniques were best for a given application.

The layout of this paper is as follows; section <A HREF="node2.html#s:morphology">II</A> 
summarises the physiological mechanisms underlying the cardiac cycle and  
reviews the morphological variability which is reflected in the ECG signal. 
A brief review of HRV is presented in 
section <A HREF="node3.html#s:hrv">III</A>. The dynamical model is introduced in 
section <A HREF="node4.html#s:model">IV</A> and investigated in section <A HREF="node5.html#s:results">V</A>. 
Section <A HREF="node6.html#s:conclusions">VI</A> concludes and discusses extensions to 
the model which may be useful for simulating specific disorders.
